## Installation

Since this project will hold both the client application and the server application there will be node modules in two different places.

Run `npm install` in `/client` and in `/server`

Create `.env` file in `/server` where it contains this following structure:

```text
JWT_SECRET=<your_secret>
MONGO_PASSWORD=<mongodb_password>
MONGO_USER=<mongodb_user>
MONGO_URL=<mongodb_url>
EMAIL=<email_for_nodemailer>
PASSWORD=<password_for_nodemailer>
```

Go to `localhost/auth/register` to add new admin in order to be able to use the app

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs both the client app and the server app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

If deploying to heroku this does not need to be run since it is handled by the heroku-postbuild script<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
